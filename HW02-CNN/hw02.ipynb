    "In this homework you will learn how to build a simple convolutional neural networks (1 convolution layer with max pooling + 1 activation layer) from scratch, and use the model to solve text classification problem. As optional, you also have a chance to build real life CNN models using Keras + Tensorflow and use it to challenge the model you build from scratch. \n",

    "<h3> 1. Math preliminaries </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Please answer all these questions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. What is the form of sigmoid function $σ(z)$ ? Show that $σ′(z) = σ(z)[1 − σ(z)]$.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another popular activation function is $tanh(z) = \\frac{e^z-e^{-z}}{e^z+e^{-z}}$ , show that $tanh′(z) = 1 − g (z)$.\n",
